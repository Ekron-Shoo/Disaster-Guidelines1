            <h2><center>What is an Earthquake?</center></h2>
			<p>An earthquake is a sudden, rapid shaking of the earth caused by the shifting of rock beneath the earth’s surface. They strike without warning, at any time of year, day or night.</p>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2><center>Top Tips</center></h2>
            
                <li>DROP COVER and HOLD ON with all members of your household. </li>
                <li>Doorways are no stronger than any other part of a structure so don’t rely on them for protection! During an earthquake, get under a sturdy piece of furniture and hold on.</li>
                <h3></h3>           
            <h2><center>What should you do During an Earthquake?</center></h2>
            <li>Staying Safe Indoors
                DROP COVER and HOLD ON! </li>
                <li>Move as little as possible - most injuries during earthquakes occur because of people moving around, falling and suffering sprains, fractures and head injuries.</li><li>
                Try to protect your head and torso.</li>
                <li>
                If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, and cover your head.</li><li>
                Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.</li><li>
                If you leave a building after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.</li>
                <li>
                Be aware that smoke alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.
                If you smell gas, get out of the house and move as far away as possible. </li>
                <li>Before you leave any building check to make sure that there is no debris from the building that could fall on you.</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                <h3></h3>           

                    
                <h2><center>Staying Safe Outdoors</center></h2>
                <li>Find a clear spot and drop to the ground. Stay there until the shaking stops. </li><li>Try to get as far away from buildings, power lines, trees, and streetlights as possible.</li><li>
                If you're in a vehicle, pull over to a clear location and stop. Avoid bridges, overpasses and power lines if possible.</li>
                <li>
                Stay inside with your seatbelt fastened until the shaking stops.</li>
                <li>
                After the shaking has stopped, drive on carefully, avoiding bridges and ramps that may have been damaged.</li><li>
                If a power line falls on your vehicle, do not get out. Wait for assistance.</li>
                <li>
                If you are in a mountainous area or near unstable slopes or cliffs, be alert for falling rocks and other debris as well as landslides.</li></p>
                <h3></h3>      
                
                
                <h2><center>After Effects</center></h2>   
            <li>If away from home, return only when authorities say it is safe to do so. </li><li>Check yourself for injuries and get first aid, if necessary, before helping injured or trapped persons.</li><li>
            After an earthquake, the disaster may continue. Expect and prepare for potential aftershocks, landslides or even a tsunami if you live on a coast. Each time you feel an aftershock, DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. Aftershocks frequently occur minutes, days, weeks and even months following an earthquake. </li><li>Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.</li></ul></p>

            <h2><center>What is a Tsunami?</center></h2>
			<p>A tsunami is a series of waves caused by earthquakes or undersea volcanic eruptions.</p>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2><center>Top Tips</center></h2>
            <li>Evacuate: DO NOT wait! Leave as soon as you see any natural signs of a tsunami or receive an official tsunami warning. </li><li> Always follow the instructions from NDRF(National Disaster Response Force). </li><li>
                Make plans to shelter with friends and family, if possible. </li><li>If you must evacuate to a public shelter, try to bring items that can help protect yourself and your family from COVID-19, such as hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent alcohol, cleaning materials, and two masks per person. Children under 2 years old, people who have trouble breathing, and people who cannot remove masks on their own should not wear them. Maintain a distance of at least six feet between yourself and those who are not part of your household. </li><li>If you are in a boat, go out from the sea. </li>
                <h3></h3>

            <h2><center>What should you do During a Tsunami?</center></h2>
            <li>If you are in a tsunami area and there is an earthquake, then first protect yourself from the earthquake. Drop, Cover, and Hold On. Drop to your hands and knees. Cover your head and neck with your arms. Hold on to any sturdy furniture until the shaking stops. Crawl only if you can reach better cover, but do not go through an area with more debris. If possible, avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose, especially after touching high-touch surfaces, to slow the spread of COVID-19. </li><li>When the shaking stops, if there are natural signs or official warnings of a tsunami, then move immediately to a safe place as high and as far inland as possible. Listen to the authorities, but do not wait for tsunami warnings and evacuation orders.</li><li>
                If you are outside of the tsunami hazard zone and receive a warning, then stay where you are unless officials tell you otherwise. </li><li>Leave immediately if you are told to do so. Evacuation routes are often marked by a wave with an arrow in the direction of higher ground. </li><li>If you are in the water, then grab onto something that floats, such as a raft, tree trunk, or door. There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through water, however floodwaters may contain debris, chemicals, or waste that are harmful to your health.  </li><li>
                If you are in a boat, then face the direction of the waves and head out to sea. If you are in a harbor, then go inland.</li>
                <h3></h3>           
                
                <h2><center>After Effects</center></h2>   
                <li>Listen to local alerts and authorities for information on areas to avoid and shelter locations.</li><li>
                Avoid wading in floodwater, which can contain dangerous debris. Water may be deeper than it appears.
                Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Underground or downed power lines can electrically charge water. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water.  Stay away from damaged buildings, roads, and bridges. </li>

            <h2></h2><center>What is a Flood?</center></h2>
			<p>Flooding is a temporary overflow of water onto land that is normally dry. Failing to evacuate flooded areas or entering flood waters can lead to injury or death.</p>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2><center>Top Tips</center></h2>
            
                <li>IF YOU ARE UNDER A FLOOD WARNING, FIND SAFE SHELTER RIGHT AWAY.</li>
                <li>Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around, Don’t Drown!</li>
                <h3></h3>       

            <h2><center>What should you do During a Flood?</center></h2>
            <li>Just six inches of moving water can knock you down, and one foot of moving water can sweep your vehicle away.</li><li>
                Stay off of bridges over fast-moving water. </li>
                <li>Evacuate if told to do so. </li><li>Move to higher ground or a higher floor.</li><li>
                    Stay where you are.</li>
                    <li>
                        If told to evacuate, do so immediately. Never drive around barricades.</li>
                        Do not walk, swim or drive through flood waters. Turn Around. Don’t Drown! </li><li>Stay off bridges over fast-moving water. Fast-moving water can wash bridges away without warning.</li><li>
                            If your car is trapped in rapidly moving water stay inside. If water is rising inside the car get on the roof. </li><li>If trapped in a building go to its highest level. Do not climb into a closed attic. You may become trapped by rising flood water. Only get on the roof if necessary and once there signal for help.</li></ul></p>
                            
                            
                
                <h3></h3>           

                    
                <h2><center>After Effects</center></h2>   
                <li>Listen to authorities for information and instructions. Return home only when authorities say it is safe.</li><li>
                    Avoid driving except in emergencies</li>
                    Be aware that snakes and other animals may be in your house. Wear heavy work gloves, protective clothing, and boots during clean up. Wear a mask and maintain a physical distance of at least six feet while working with someone else. Use an appropriate mask if cleaning mold or other debris. People with asthma and other lung conditions and/or immunosuppression should not enter buildings with indoor water leaks or mold growth that can be seen or smelled. Children should not take part in disaster cleanup work. </li><li>Be aware of the risk of electrocution. Do not touch electrical equipment if it is wet or if you are standing in water. If it is safe to do so, turn off the electricity to prevent electric shock.</li><li>
                        Avoid wading in flood water, which can be contaminated and contain dangerous debris. Underground or downed power lines can also electrically charge the water. There is no evidence that COVID-19 can be transmitted through water; however, you should avoid contact with floodwaters. </li><li>Continue taking steps to protect yourself from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, such as washing your hands often and cleaning commonly touched surfaces with disinfecting products.</li><li>
                        Use a generator or other gasoline-powered machinery ONLY outdoors and away from windows.</li>

            <h2><center>What is a Landslide?</center></h2>
			<p>A landslide is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. Landslides are a type of "mass wasting," which denotes any down-slope movement of soil and rock under the direct influence of gravity.</p>
            <h3></h3>

            <h2><center>Top Tips</center></h2>
            
                <li>Stay alert and awake. Many debris-flow fatalities occur when people are sleeping. Listen to a NOAA Weather Radio or portable, battery-powered radio or television for warnings of intense rainfall. Be aware that intense, short bursts of rain may be particularly dangerous, especially after longer periods of heavy rainfall and damp weather.</li>
                <li>If you are in areas susceptible to landslides and debris flows, consider leaving if it is safe to do so. Remember that driving during an intense storm can be hazardous. If you remain at home, move to a second story if possible. </li>
                <h3></h3>      
                
                
            <h2><center>What should you do During a Landslide?</center></h2>
            <li>Listen for any unusual sounds that might indicate moving debris, such as trees cracking or boulders knocking together. A trickle of flowing or falling mud or debris may precede larger landslides. Moving debris can flow quickly and sometimes without warning.If you are near a stream or channel, be alert for any sudden increase or decrease in water flow and for a change from clear to muddy water. Such changes may indicate landslide activity upstream, so be prepared to move quickly. Don't delay! Save yourself, not your belongings.</li>
            <li>Be especially alert when driving. Bridges may be washed out, and culverts overtopped. Do not cross flooding streams!! Turn Around, Don't Drown®!. Embankments along roadsides are particularly susceptible to landslides. Watch the road for collapsed pavement, mud, fallen rocks, and other indications of possible debris flows.</li>
            <li>Be aware that strong shaking from earthquakes can induce or intensify the effects of landslides.
                </li>

                <h3></h3>           

                    
                
                <h2><center>After Effects</center></h2>   
                <li>Stay away from the slide area. There may be danger of additional slides.
</li><li>Listen to local radio or television stations for the latest emergency information. Watch for flooding, which may occur after a landslide or debris flow. Floods sometimes follow landslides and debris flows because they may both be started by the same event.
</li><li>Check for injured and trapped persons near the slide, without entering the direct slide area. Direct rescuers to their locations
</li><li>Help a neighbor who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people, and people with disabilities. Elderly people and people with disabilities may require additional assistance. People who care for them or who have large families may need additional assistance in emergency situations
</li><li>Look for and report broken utility lines and damaged roadways and railways to appropriate authorities. Reporting potential hazards will get the utilities turned off as quickly as possible, preventing further hazard and injury.
</li><li>Check the building foundation, chimney, and surrounding land for damage. Damage to foundations, chimneys, or surrounding land may help you assess the safety of the area.
</li><li>Replant damaged ground as soon as possible since erosion caused by loss of ground cover can lead to flash flooding and additional landslides in the near future.
</li><li>Seek advice from a geotechnical expert for evaluating landslide hazards or designing corrective techniques to reduce landslide risk. A professional will be able to advise you of the best ways to prevent or reduce landslide risk, without creating further hazard.
